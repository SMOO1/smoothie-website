This is a work in progress website about smoothie recipes that I come across, with information about various smoothie ingredients. I started this website because of my love for smoothies and to learn web development. So far this website only has front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The hosting platform I use is w3schools spaces, which is completely free only for front end (back end requires a payment). The website is currently only properly viewable on PC, mobile devices may experience text cut-offs on the left side of their screen (sorry! trying to fix it!) 

The link to the website is: [(https://muchsmoothies.w3spaces.com/)]
